# Tools

Train classifier from BB table (select model, bb crop augment parameters (GOOD defaults!), epoch to train etc)

Apply classifier predictions and embeddings to table (replace with existing if done before), optionally also apply to Run and Table (then you specify run only )- ability to save Packmap/Umap transform, so can be used in subsequent runs, so must take param in to load transform as well instead of calculating it.

Populate a table with GOOD image statistics (like Encord)

Export table to Coco/Yolo

Create table from Coco/Yolo
