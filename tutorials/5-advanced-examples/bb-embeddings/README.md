# Per bounding box embeddings

This directory contains tutorials for generating per-bounding-box and per-segmentation embeddings and image metrics (brightness, sharpness, contrast).
The functionality is also exposed in the CLI tool `augment_instance_table`, for more details, run:

```bash
3lc-tools run augment-instance-table --help
```

+ [Fine-tune a classifier (bounding boxes)](1-train-crop-model.ipynb) Train a classifier on crops generated by bounding boxes in an object detection dataset.
+ [Collect embeddings & metrics (bounding boxes)](2-collect-bb-metrics.ipynb) Collect embeddings from the fine-tuned classifier for each bounding box in the dataset, reduce them to 3D and add them to the table.

+ [Fine-tune a classifier (segmentation)](1-train-crop-model-seg.ipynb) Train a classifier on crops generated by segmentations in a segmentation dataset.
+ [Collect embeddings & metrics (segmentation)](2-collect-bb-metrics-seg.ipynb) Collect embeddings from the fine-tuned classifier for each segmentation in the dataset, reduce them to 3D and add them to the table.
