# Per bounding box embeddings

+ [Fine-tune a classifier](1-train-crop-model.ipynb) Train a classifier on crops generated by bounding boxes in an object detection dataset.
+ [Collect embeddings & metrics](2-collect-bb-metrics.ipynb) Collect embeddings from the fine-tuned classifier for each bounding box in the dataset, reduce them to 3D and add them to the table.
