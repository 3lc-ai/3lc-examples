# Modify Tables

Once you have created your Tables, these tutorials show you how to enrich and transform them. Learn to add embeddings, compute metrics, perform dimensionality reduction, apply data splits, and augment your tables with new data. You'll also discover how to transform annotations (e.g., converting bounding boxes to segmentations), compute per-instance metrics, and create weighted coresets for efficient training.

These techniques are essential for data analysis, quality improvement, and preparing datasets for machine learning workflows.
