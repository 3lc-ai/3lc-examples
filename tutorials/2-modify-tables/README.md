Hereâ€™s a placeholder table for the specified notebooks, formatted with three columns per row:

|  |  |  |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Add Image Metrics | Add Embeddings | Add Global Image Metrics |
| [![add-image-metrics](../images/placeholder.png)](add-image-metrics.ipynb) | [![add-embeddings](../images/placeholder.png)](add-embeddings.ipynb) | [![add-classification-metrics](../images/placeholder.png)](add-classification-metrics.ipynb) |
| This notebook covers adding image metrics, showing how to compute and store metrics associated with each image. |  This notebook demonstrates adding embeddings, allowing for advanced searches and similarity comparisons. | Explores adding global image metrics to enhance dataset-level analysis and aggregation. |
| Split Tables | Add New Data | Add New Data and Split |
| [![split-tables](../images/placeholder.png)](split-tables.ipynb) | [![add-new-data](../images/placeholder.png)](add-new-data.ipynb) | [![add-new-data-and-split](../images/placeholder.png)](add-new-data-and-split.ipynb) |
| Learn to split tables into subsets based on conditions or sample splits for targeted processing. | This notebook focuses on adding new data entries, demonstrating how to expand datasets with fresh information. | This notebook provides two ways of adding new data to a dataset with existing split Tables. |
