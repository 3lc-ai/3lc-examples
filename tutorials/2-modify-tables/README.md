# Modify Tables

This folder contains notebooks demonstrating how to create modify and extend tables in 3LC.

Here’s a placeholder table for the specified notebooks, formatted with three columns per row:

|  |  |  |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Add Image Metrics | Add Embeddings | Add Global Image Metrics |
| [![add-image-metrics](../images/add-image-metrics.png)](add-image-metrics.ipynb) <br> This notebook covers adding image metrics, showing how to compute and store metrics associated with each image. | [![add-embeddings](../images/add-embeddings.png)](add-embeddings.ipynb) <br> This notebook demonstrates adding embeddings, allowing for advanced searches and similarity comparisons. | [![add-global-image-metrics](../images/add-global-image-metrics.png)](add-global-image-metrics.ipynb) <br> Explores adding global image metrics to enhance dataset-level analysis and aggregation. |
| Split Tables | Add New Data |  |
| [![split-tables](../images/split-tables.png)](split-tables.ipynb) <br> Learn to split tables into subsets based on conditions or sample splits for targeted processing. | [![add-new-data](../images/add-new-data.png)](add-new-data.ipynb) <br> This notebook focuses on adding new data entries, demonstrating how to expand datasets with fresh information. |  |

Each cell includes:
- An image linked to the corresponding notebook.
- A brief description of each notebook’s content.

Replace `../images/*.png` with the appropriate image paths, and customize the descriptions if needed.
