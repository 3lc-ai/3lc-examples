| This notebook covers adding image metrics such as brightness, sharpness, and contrast. |  This notebook demonstrates adding and reducing embeddings from a pre-trained model, allowing for advanced searches and similarity comparisons. | Explores adding the global image metrics "diversity" and "uniqueness", using pre-computed embedding and label columns. |

| Learn to split tables into subsets based on conditions or sample splits for targeted processing. | This notebook focuses on adding new data entries, demonstrating how to expand datasets with fresh information. | This notebook provides two ways of adding new data to a dataset with existing split Tables. |
