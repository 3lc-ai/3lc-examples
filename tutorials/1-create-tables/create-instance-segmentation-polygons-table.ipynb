    "# Create Table from instance segmentation polygons\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a table of instance segmentation polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Instance segmentation\", as opposed to \"semantic segmentation\", refers to situations where each \"object\" in your dataset has some associated segmentation mask (in this case described by a polygon) which might overlap with other objects. \"Semantic segmentation\", by contrast, refers to situations where each pixel in each image of your dataset is associated with exactly one class label. See [Import semantic segmentation dataset](https://github.com/3lc-ai/3lc-examples/blob/main/tutorials/1-create-tables/create-semantic-segmentation-dataset.ipynb) for an example of how to create a table from semantic segmentation masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use instance segmentations represented as a list of polygons. For an example of how to use instance segmentations represented as per-pixel masks, see [this notebook](https://github.com/3lc-ai/3lc-examples/blob/main/tutorials/1-create-tables/create-instance-segmentation-masks-table.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the COCO128 for this example. Note that while 3LC has built-in functionality to facilitate the loading of COCO-style datasets, this example will more \"manually\" load the dataset to demonstrate how this can be done in general."
