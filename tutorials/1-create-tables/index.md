# Create Tables

Learn how to create 3LC Tables from various data sources and formats. These tutorials cover everything from simple image folders to complex annotation formats including COCO, YOLO, and custom data structures. You'll also find specialized guides for different computer vision tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), and 3D point clouds.

Start here to transform your existing datasets into 3LC Tables.
