    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a table of instance segmentation masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Instance segmentation\", as opposed to \"semantic segmentation\", refers to situations where each \"object\" in your dataset has some associated segmentation mask which might overlap with other objects. \"Semantic segmentation\", by contrast, refers to situations where each pixel in each image of your dataset is associated with exactly one class label. See [this notebook](https://github.com/3lc-ai/3lc-examples/blob/main/tutorials/1-create-tables/create-semantic-segmentation-dataset.ipynb) for an example of how to create a table from semantic segmentation masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use instance segmentations represented as a 3D tensor of shape `(width, height, num_instances)`. For an example of how to use instance segmentations represented as polygons, see [this notebook](https://github.com/3lc-ai/3lc-examples/blob/main/tutorials/1-create-tables/create-instance-segmentation-polygons-table.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the COCO128 for this example. Note that while 3LC has built-in functionality to facilitate the loading of COCO-style datasets, this example will more \"manually\" load the dataset to demonstrate how this can be done in general."
